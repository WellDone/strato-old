# WellDone Strato Data Portal
[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/WellDone/Strato?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Demo site available at http://strato.welldone.org.  It should reflect the [master](https://github.com/WellDone/Strato/tree/master) branch of this repository, whereas bleeding-edge, possibly-broken code is on the [dev](https://github.com/WellDone/Strato/tree/dev) branch.

This portal is designed to complement WellDone's Mobile Monitor ([MoMo](http://www.github.com/welldone/MoMo-Firmware)) hardware remote monitoring platform.

# Development and Deployment

To spin up a test application deployment using [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com) and [VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org):
* Run `vagrant up` - The first time this is run it will download a 700MB virtualbox VM from Vagrant Cloud, so be patient.
* Profit - the server should be accessible at https://localhost:3001
* NOTE: Previously the server listened only on http (http://localhost:3000) - it still does, but will redirect to the default ssh port (https://localhost:443) which is different than the one Vagrant binds for https (3001).  Go directly to the https version to avoid this issue.

To deploy a production or test box to a public cloud ([AWS](http://aws.amazon.com/) or [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com/)):
* Build a base box by running `build.sh <provider>` from the 'packer' directory, <provider> may be digitalocean or amazon-ebs (untested)
* Using the image generated by packer, spin up a new cloud VM
* Run `deploy.sh -p user@123.456.789.101` (where 'user' is a user with sudo priveleges on the cloud machine located at 123.456.789.101) from the root repo directory.  You must have established implicit ssh trust (using ssh identity keys) with the user on the remote machine.
